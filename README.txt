The objective of this game would be to attack other planets using rockets and lasers. 
Currently, I only have star animations and backgrounds working. Exact details of the game will be implemented as I go on.

This is made using LibGDX in java.

Features implemented so far:
- Background
- Stars + animations

Next steps:
- Add planets and planet generating
- Add rockets with collision
- Add weapons
- Add levels / menus 
- AI
